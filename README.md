## Stonks! Inspiration:

- The learning curve is steep for users new to trading stocks, takes time to research and to maintain!
- COVID-19 has brought on the loss of jobs, passive income or existing savings is important to sustain living standards.

## What it does:
- 3 different mathematical algorithms to automate stock trading, allowing users to customize based on risk tolerance level
- ability to simulate with paper money before committing to the selected trading algorithm
- simple UI to abstract away hard to understand information from complicated finance stock sites, easy to understand for beginners
- recommended stocks based on stocks users is currently interested in
- newsfeed for market updates
*Please note we are currently unable to establish a backend server connection to our stock prediction algorithm, however, all data is based on actual data generated by our algorithm*

## How we built it:
- React
- Python
- Javascript

## Challenges we ran into:
- It was all of our first time building a site purely off of React!
- It was difficult learning the syntax and piecing things together.
- Difficult to link backend algorithm to frontend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:d
- First time learning React! We are proud to be able to add as many details as we did to showcase our core features.
- **WINNER of our FIRST HACKATHON!!**

## What we learned:
- How to build a responsive site through React
- React syntax
- How to generate graph data using React
- How to style using React
- Different methods for predicting stock market buy/sell
- Python algorithms for the decision to buy/sell stocks
- How to use API libraries

## What's next for Stonks?
Our team is looking into learning how to establish a python backend server to create a fully functional automatic bot to stock trade.
